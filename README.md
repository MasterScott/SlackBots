# SlackBots
This repo contains scripts for the Slack Bots referenced in my blog post [Slack Bots for Trolls and Work](https://bluescreenofjeff.com/2017-04-11-slack-bots-for-trolls-and-work/)

**chatspam.sh** - a while loop to spam ghosts to Slack via incoming webhook

**famecheck.py** - Slack slash command bot that takes a Twitter handle and returns a snarky comment about the follower count of the user to Slack

**StoryBot** - Slack slash command to tell a story via incoming webhook, one line at a time after a random sleep interval

**TrollBot** - Slack slash command that takes a username and returns a random troll from a preconfigured dicitonary for that specific user
