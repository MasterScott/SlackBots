On this very night
Ten years ago
Along this same stretch of road in a dense fog just like this.
I saw the worst accident I ever seen.
There was this sound, like a garbage truck dropped off the Empire State Building...
And when they finally pulled the drivers body from the twisted, burning wreck.
It looked like this!!!
